## Potions

Healing potions are made from two components, a medicinal herb or oil, and a healthy blood. The first part of the potion, herb/oil, helps decide the kind of die roll with the type of blood being a multiplier to the equation.

Blood, or b in the following equations, is equal to the constitution modifier of creature the blood is taken from. All potions also require a bottle in order to create and be held in. 

| Medicinal Herb/Oil | Nature/Survival Search Check | Equation        |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------- | --------------- |
| Minor              | >= 10                        | (1 + b) d4 + b  |
| Greater            | >= 15                        | (1 + b) d6 + b  |
| Superior           | >= 25                        | (1 + b) d8 + b  |
| Uber               | >= 30                        | (1 + b) d10 + b |

Materials can also be used to make specific potions if desired too. Though players may still use the following material combinations to make a healing potion instead. In the following requirements tab the first letter refers to the level of herb/oil needed and the rest are materials specific to the potion.

## Firearms 

These work very similar the effects of bows with some minor differences. One of the key things needed to be considered is that your rifle is technically alive and so potions have an effect on them. 

The following table should be a quick reference to what information you would need about each specific firearm. The damage type assume that you are using standard bullets, which you may consider that you have unlimited of, but if you are using special bullets make sure to consider the bullets table after. 

| Name | Damage | Damage Type | Range | Properties |
| ---- | ------ | ----------- | ----- | ---------- |
|      |        |             |       |            |
|      |        |             |       |            |
|      |        |             |       |            |
|      |        |             |       |            |
