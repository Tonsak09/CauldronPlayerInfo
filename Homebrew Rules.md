## Potions

Healing potions are made from two components, a medicinal herb or oil, and healthy blood. The first part of the potion, herb/oil, helps decide the kind of die roll with the type of blood being a multiplier to the equation.

Blood, or b in the following equations, is equal to the constitution modifier of  the creature the blood is taken from. All potions also require a bottle or vial in order to create and be held in. The table also shows the difficulty it would take to forage for the herb/oil. 

| Herb/Oil | Nature Search Check | Equation        |
| -------- | ------------------- | --------------- |
| Minor    | >= 10               | (1 + b) d4 + b  |
| Greater  | >= 15               | (1 + b) d6 + b  |
| Superior | >= 25               | (1 + b) d8 + b  |
| Uber     | >= 30               | (1 + b) d10 + b |

Materials can also be used to make specific potions if desired too. Though players may still use the following material combinations to make a healing potion instead. In the following requirements tab the first letter refers to the level of herb/oil needed and the rest are materials specific to the potion. 

Harvesting blood can be done on any freshly deceased biological creature. The amount of blood and difficulty of retrieving blood is related the size of the creature.

In the following table there is a column called attempts. A creature can be harvested that many times before it cannot be harvested more. Within the *n blood vial* columns we can see how many vials of the creatures blood a character can extract based on their rolled survival check. Blank spots mean that amount cannot be harvested

Soaking is a free action in which you apply reed potions into your weapon. Typically these are referred to as elixir throughout the lands as to differentiate them from potions meant for sentient creatures. 

The following list are the different common elixirs that can be bought, found, or crafted in the world. Note that to be able to craft these you are required to have some relation to the Ornish Wisdom. 

The soaked property lasts until the end of your turn unless stated otherwise.
