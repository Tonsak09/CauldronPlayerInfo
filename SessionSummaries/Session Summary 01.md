 "What's the deal with the sharpshooter?"
> Orn is known for the creation of firearms and are always looking for the next technological leap. The stone that the party is transporting comes from past Cauldron making it very valuable. Its odd kinetic reactions when taking damage could be exploited if siezed by the Ornish Wisdom. It may just be enough for them to siege war on the neighboring nations... 

- Introduced **Clareskir** as employer for job to retrive **Shi-Eh-Gi**, a wicked chimera, from **Echoes-Vine**
- The key to getting into the fortress was to be using a large stone that came originally from past Cauldron
- The party went and retrieved the stone east from **Brave-Point**. Saw that it was carted and immediately went back for horses
- Found a stable run by a human named Karra. She treated most of her horses well. 
- Distracted Karra by not pissing behind the stables and took two horses, **Bleeder** and **Shallow**
- Brought horses back to cart and began journey to Echoes-Vine
- Eventually came by combustible crabs which were dealt with and collected 
- Party is investigated at night by and ornish sharpshooter
- Tarantula named **Scuddle**
- Came upon a swamp-drake named **Hov-Ir**
- Party fed him some crab but he wanted something more fancy 
- Party collected some ingredients in the area to add to a jumbo
- Ipp took Hov-Ir's egg and would drop it, killing the partially formed drake by spilling it onto the ground
- Combat ensued in which Hov-Ir was critically wounded and fled. The party had a significant chance to kill Hov-Ir as he was fleeing but chose not too 
- Talking tree that spoke about fearing "*Those made of vine and have shards of purple*". Friend of Hov-Ir
- Resting at night the party would be investigated further
- Scratch and Lisbornus went out to see. They spoke with a jackalwere who called them nasty 
- Gnats everywhere. Shallow's eyes went black because of how many gnats were on them. Seven made goggles out of vials for Shallow 
- Arrived at Echos-Vine. A collection of stone manors that lead up to keep at the top of a hill. 
- Saw a **Vile** collecting information within the manors far from **Hell**. Stope four pages worth of information but is in infernal. Need to find a translator 
- Collected information about the **Crusted Crown** which originates from Cauldron
- Saw some form of grey goo being licked by giant rats. Scratch got out of there before things got crazy 
- Eventually went to the lesser gate and delivered the stone before leaving the keep (??????)
- Seven and Ipp would climb into the keep 
- Scratch tried to impersonate their way in. It did not work 
- Lisbornus learned more about the Crusted Crown and saw the vile from earlier 
- Ipp would slip into the keep and be harassed by a captain. The captain would trauma dump and another intervening knight stepped between 
- Seven would get soup poured onto them and shoot the cook in the eye
- Would speak briefly with Shi-Eh-Gi before freeing them 
- Seven would try to lasso Shi-Eh-Gi and would be successful. They are not being dragged away in the air
