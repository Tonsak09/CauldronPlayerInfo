This is an adventure that has the players explore a new continent discovered past a dangerous stretch of territory called Cauldron. They may be going out in order to feel the thrill of adventure, experience foreign magic, help hunt down the lost cartographer Paol Gielby, or something completely else! 

Though the plot is tethered around searching for Paol, players do not need this to be their character's primary goal.

This adventure has players start with three levels but if they wish to have a "greater" magic class it is recommended to have a ratio of at least 1:2 with "common" magic class being the majority. The following table shows which classes are deemed to the type of magic user they are. The rarity of each class in the world is shown with more x's indicate a higher rarity. 

If you do feel like you would like to play a full "greater" magic user please feel free to make a build that makes your happy.

The people of the world are less naturally magic than other campaigns but still utilize magic properties of the world to achieve interesting and equally dramatic results. Items will hopefully play a more significant role in this campaign feeling useful and unique.  

The rest of this document goes over some nations or factions that you may want your character to come from and a bit of lore to go with them. At the end there is a brief bit about the Wicked who have had a strong influence on the conflict this campaign takes place around. 

## Frontier Knights

*Excerpt from Conflicts on the Border of Cauldron by Knight Rayer*
> A flickering flame exists in all of us that can make the fantastical to become tangible. Some are rewarded burning hearths for their loyalty to beings beyond or some others are lucky enough to be born inheriting from passtorch lineages, but most of us come with mere smoldering embers. Enough perhaps to light a candle on a dark night but not enough to hold against the wicked things that come from Cauldron. 
> 
> The Frontier Knights are made from the brave men and women that stand against wicked and vile creatures not relying on spellcraft or enchantment but of guns and steel. We are the bulwark and the people of the cities and we are steadfast against all foes.

This group is made up of the populations of many different nations who have gone to fight back against the Wicked. They populate the entire border of Cauldron in settlements that range from mighty keeps to glorified campsites.

## Orn

*Excerpt from Empire of Blood by Paol Gielby*
> Ornish wisdom has gifted, or more accurately sold, us with the modern firearms we so often use today. Specially tailored and grown reeds are to be used as the primary mechanism and only once they have reached maturity are they implemented with the lever action injector. Yes, rifles are alive as to fire it is necessary to pump a special concoction into them in to cause a chemical reaction leading to the ejection of whatever material is in its barrel. 

This nation is currently largest land mass that borders against Cauldron and so is in constant conflict with the Wicked and are the largest funders of the Frontier Knights despite their uneasy relationship.

*Excerpt from Empire of Blood by Paol Gielby*
> Ornish blood merchants have not always been the shunned group that they are today. Due to how integral blood is for the creation of potions and how difficult it can be to get exotic materials in areas where trade lines are weak or nonexistent these merchants have played an integral role in keeping less fortunate populations healthy. (...)

Orn is known for their development of rifles and blood trade. Through experimentation and sheer economic will Ornish wisdom has found itself on the frontier of alchemy. If you choose to be related or come from this nation you will have some more insights and relations to potion craft and firearm development. 
## Miocho  

*Interview with Echo Priest Twindoch*
> The stars obviously have something to say because they will not shut up. 

Compared to their neighbors in Orn the people of Miocho live more modest and sustainable lives. Do not let their rolling hills, warm hearths, and delicious food fool you though, the people would defend their homes tooth and nail. Having a population made primarily of descendants from giants and a human population that finally found a home after generations of travel means that despite their land and population being being smaller on the global scale they are a force to be reckoned with.

*Ponderings of Blood Merchant Hin*
> How is it that may take years of work in order to create even a single glyph that may be used up in mere seconds? Some may take the firbolg's of Miocho to be airheads who spend most of their time daydreaming instead of honing their craft; reluctant to work until necessary. The way I see it is their time enjoying life is how they improve their skills. How can one base their science around the livings of a content life if one does not spend most of their time living contently? 

Miocho is know for their work on glyphs to improve armour, weapons, but especially tools. Much of what they have learned comes from their study of the cosmos and how the universe ebbs and flows. If you choose to be related or come from this nation you will have some insights and relations to glyph work and the cosmos.

## Leenduk

*A heated response from Sultan Brenciar Nyelmaathinis to Paol Gielby*
> It is about precision and command. Capturing the future requires more than gazing upon the sky and drinking sweet teas. To understand the nuances of the world you must become apart of it, embrace the elements of the land and allow them to become apart of you as much as you are of it. 

The heated sands a jagged rocks of Leenduk may seem unhospitable to most races but to those that live there consider it paradise. The society follows a strict hierarchy with powering leading to the various sultans of the land. Though not directly bording Cauldron they are economic partners and neighbors of both Miocho and Orn meaning that services of Leenduk has found its way to the front.

Leenduck is known for their work on prediction. A Leenduk diviner may give their client a favorable opportunity to change their fate in their future or a diviner may be hired for a substantial rate. This nation has come to power from their uncanny ability to predict the future and by selling this service to others. If you choose to be related or come from this nation you will have some insights and relations to divination and element craft. 
## The Wicked 

*Excerpt from Empire of Blood by Paol Gielby*
> After the horde of wicked finally broke through the Frontier Knight's line at Echo's Vine the nation of Orn suffered the brunt of the casualties from the creatures rampage. They had even made it all the way to the capital city of Reomry before being slain and their bodies finally brought back to Cauldron.
